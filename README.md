# HyperMod
A Discord Moderator Bot made with JavaScipt!

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need:

Node.js v16.2 at the minimum
An IDE ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) etc.)
Knowledge of making a Discord bot and Discord server and how to get the bot's Application ID, token and the Server's Guild ID

# Making the Discord Bot
1. Go to the [Discord Development Portal](https://developer.discord.com/applications).
2. Click "New Application."
3. Call it whatever you want. I named mine HyperMod.
4. Go to the "Bot" tab and click "Create Bot". Then, Click "Yes, do it!"
5. You have to reset the bot token in order to get the bot's token. You can only see it when you first reset it, so, copy it to a text document or keep it in a safe place.

# Inviting the bot to your server
1. Go to Oauth2
2. Go to URL Handler
3. Click "bot" and "application.commands" in the top box.
4. Click "Administrator" in the 2nd box.
5. Copy and paste the generated URL in a new tab.
6. Follow the prompts to invite the bot to your server.

# Getting the bot ready
1. Download the Source code.
2. Extract it somewhere safe.
3. Launch your IDE, and create a file called ".env".
4. Add the bot's token there by typing: token: "your-bot-token-here" 
5. Create another file called "config.json".
